## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2022-07-10

## [2.1.1] - 2022-12-09
### Fixed
 - Fixed wrong minimum iOS deployment target when using Carthage.

## [2.1.0] - 2022-06-03
### Added
 - Added support for SwiftUI, by providing `.gradientProgressBar` as a `ProgressViewStyle`.

### Added
 - Added support for Swift Package Manager.

## [2.0.2] - 2019-29-11
### Changed
- Updated dependency (LightweightObservable)[https://github.com/fxm90/LightweightObservable] to version 2 and adapt changes.

## [2.0.1] - 2019-23-09
### Added
 - Support for dark mode on iOS 13

 - Set access control to `public` for layers on `GradientProgressBar`, in order to allow further configuration in subclasses ([#8])

## [2.0.0] - 2019-28-08
### Changed
 - Changed subclassing from `UIProgressView` to `UIView`, in order to make framework more failure safe (e.g. due to accidentally setting `progressTintColor`)
### Added
 - Interface builder support

## [1.2.9] - 2019-09-06
### Fixed
 - Fixed Carthage build failed due to non shared scheme
### Changed
 - Moved observable implementation into a framework (`LightweightObservable`) and added it as dependency

## [1.2.8] - 2019-04-04
### Changed
 - Added support for Swift 5.0

## [1.2.7] - 2019-03-16
### Changed
- Changed class access control to `open` in order to allow subclassing `GradientProgressBar` (fixes issue [#5](https://github.com/fxm90/GradientProgressBar/issues/5)).

## [1.2.6] - 2019-02-13
### Changed
- Remove dependency `Observable` in favour of a more lightweight implementation
- Small internal refactorings and cleanup

## [1.2.5] - 2018-16-11
### Changed
- Adapt code to support new version from dependency `Observable`

## [1.2.4] - 2018-22-09
### Changed
 - Changes for Swift 4.2
 - Removed `UIColor` initializers, as they're not required for the project to work (and it's not very common to use hex color codes in iOS)
